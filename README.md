Hospitals and blood banks often face difficulty in quickly finding suitable blood donors during emergencies.
Current problems include:

Donor information stored in registers or scattered Excel files
No real-time availability tracking
Time-consuming manual search
Difficulty filtering donors by blood group and location
No proper tracking of total donation history
Delays during emergency situations
In critical cases, even a small delay in finding a matching donor can cost lives.

Proposed Solution

To solve this issue, we developed a Blood Donation Management Web Application from the hospital’s point of view.

The system allows:

Hospital admin, Blood bank admin to register donor details
Update donor availability
Track total donation count
Store contact information

Search donors by:
Blood Group

The application is built using:
Python
Streamlit (for web interface)
SQLite (local database)

The system runs on localhost and is designed for hospital internal use.

Why We Chose This Solution

Hospital-Centered Approach
Instead of allowing donors to self-register publicly, this system is controlled by hospital administrators, ensuring:
Verified donor data
Accurate updates
Secure information management
